# Tutorial Introduction

This tutorial is a guide on how to use NanoIso. The tool has been optimized predominantly to be run either from the `Preprocessing` module or `Translation` module. Also, the `Analysis` proportion of the pipeline is dependent on provided files or results from the `Processing` part of the pipeline, but vice versa is not true.

For the tutorial, test data has been provided and can be downloaded from the repository.
