# Prion

Furthermore, prion subsequences are another way to study the translation effects of transcripts.

[PLAAC](https://github.com/whitehead/plaac) was implemented to identify prion subsequences.

## Usage

Input - `/Genes/GENE/Transcripts/x_protein.fa`

Output - `/Genes/GENE/Transcripts/x_prion_score.txt`


## Output Folder Structure

```
| -- Genes/
    | -- GENE/
        | -- Transcripts/
            | -- x_prion_score.txt
            ...
```
